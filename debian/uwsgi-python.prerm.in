# dh_installdeb will replace this with shell code automatically

# debhelper generates 'invoke-rc.d @@uwsgi_binary@@ stop', but init.d script
# doesn't proceed to work if @@uwsgi_binary@@ executable doesn't exists.
#
# So we should remove @@uwsgi_binary@@ executable _after_ executing shell code
# generated by debhelper scripts.
