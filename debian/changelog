uwsgi (0.9.8-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Resolve package building issues on some architectures:
    - exclude uwsgi-plugin-luajit from building on armel architecture.
      Build-Dependency libluajit-5.1-dev doesn't available on armel,
      bug #630814 was filed.
    - remove Build-Dependency on libsctp-dev.
      Build-Dependency on libsctp-dev prevents packages from building on
      architectures kfreebsd-i386, kfreebsd-amd64, hurd-i386.
      SCTP build option doesn't handled by uWSGI build configuration since
      20 Oct 2010 (Mercurial changeset f1841e46cd29). So Build-Dependency on
      libsctp-dev could be safely discarded without loss of any uWSGI
      features.
    - restrict set of uwsgi-plugin-greenlet-python architectures to
      amd64, i386, mips, powerpc, s390 (where python-greenlet and
      python-greenlet-dev packages are available).
