uwsgi (0.9.8-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Exclude uwsgi-plugin-luajit from building on armel architecture.
    Build-Dependency libluajit-5.1-dev doesn't available on armel, bug #630814
    was filed.
  * Remove Build-Dependency on libsctp-dev.
    SCTP build option doesn't handled by uWSGI build configuration since
    20 Oct 2010 (Mercurial changeset f1841e46cd29). So Build-Dependency on
    libsctp-dev could be safely discarded without loss of any uWSGI features.
    With discarding of this Build-Dependency packages could be built on
    kfreebsd-i386, kfreebsd-amd64 and hurd-i386 architectures.
  * Restrict set of uwsgi-plugin-greenlet-python architectures to amd64, i386,
    mips, powerpc, s390 (where python-greenlet and python-greenlet-dev
    packages are available).
