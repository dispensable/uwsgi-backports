Building uwsgi-pythonX.Y package for new Python version
=======================================================

Rules for building uwsgi-pythonX.Y are created automatically based on
contents of debian/control.

For building uWSGI for new Python version one's only necessary to add new
package (for example, 'uwsgi-python13.0') in debian/control.

Algorithmically speaking (see it in debian/rules):
  1. Function list_pkgname_suffixes greps debian/control for substring
     'Package: uwsgi-python', then removes this substring from each found line.
     Remaining lines' suffixes are needing Python versions (2.5 or 2.6 or ...).
  2. List of found suffixes is assigned to variable 'python_ver'.
  3. Bunch of rules (each for building specific uwsgi-pythonX.Y) is generated
     from 'python_ver' variable.
  4. In each of these rules specific Python intepreter (python2.5 or python2.6
     or ...) is called for executing 'uwsgiconfig.py --build'.

Building new uwsgi-plugin-X package
===================================

Rules for building uwsgi-plugin-X are created automatically based on
contents of debian/control.

For building new uWSGI plugin one's only necessary to add new package (for
example, 'uwsgi-plugin-brainfuck') in debian/control.

Algorithmically speaking (see it in debian/rules):
  1. Function list_pkgname_suffixes greps debian/control for substring
     'Package: uwsgi-plugin-', then removes this substring from each found
     line. Remaining lines' suffixes are needing plugin names (lua or psgi
     or ...).
  2. List of found suffixes is assigned to variable 'plugins'.
  3. Bunch of rules (each for building specific plugin) is generated from
     'plugins' variable.
  4. In each of these rules 'uwsgiconfig.py --plugin <specific plugin location>'
     is executed.
