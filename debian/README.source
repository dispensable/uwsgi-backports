uWSGI for Python 2.* should be compiled without '-fstrict-aliasing' to avoid 
warning 'dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules'
about well-known Python 2.* API "feature".

CDBS automatically adds '-O2' to CFLAGS and this optimization level includes
'-fstrict-aliasing'. So it is overriden (with '-fno-strict-aliasing')
specifically for packages 'uwsgi-python2.*'.
