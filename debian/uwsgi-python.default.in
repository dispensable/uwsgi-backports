# At startup VERBOSE value is setted in 'no'. So when user invokes
# @@uwsgi_binary@@ init.d script, no output is showed.
# It could be unexpected behaviour, because it is common practice for
# init.d script to ignore VERBOSE value.
# Here VERBOSE is overriden to conform such the practice.

# Should init.d script print configuration file names while marking progress of
# it's execution?
#
# If 'no', then init.d script prints one-character symbols instead file names.
#
# Printing confnames is quite informative, but could mess terminal output or
# be somewhat dangerous (as filename could contain arbitary characters).
# ASCII control characters in file names are replaced with '?' in init.d script
# output, nevertheless you were warned.

# init.d script starts instance of @@uwsgi_binary@@ daemon for each found
# user-created configuration file.
#
# These options are passed to each instance of @@uwsgi_binary@@, runned by
# init.d script.
#
# Note: options '--socket', '--daemonize' and '--pidfile' are always added
#       automatically by init.d script
#
# Default socket location: /var/run/@@uwsgi_binary@@/<confname>/socket
# Tip: you could override '--socket' in configuration file.
